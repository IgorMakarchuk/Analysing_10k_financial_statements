# Analysing_10k_financial_statements
Here we performed our first NLP analysis of 10K financial paper, for the companies of our interest.

For this project, we focused on extracting, pre-processing, analysing 10K financial statements found in SEC (American Security and Exchange Commission).

10K financial statement is a yearly report on the performance of the company.

In this project we learn basic tools of how to extract 10k financial documents from the SEC’s website.
Pre-process them and reduce them to the data that we might be interested in.
Use basic tools such as tokenisation, lemmatisation, and bag of words to see what kind of relevant sentiments we might find.
Further we used Jaccardian similarity along with Cosine similarity to see how document’s sentiments were changing within some time frame. 

At the moment this is an ongoing project, were later we will tie this information to the pricing, to create a relevant alpha indicator, to understand the performance of our companies, and if they might be interesting for the investment….
